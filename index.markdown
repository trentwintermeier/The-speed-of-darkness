<h1 align=center> Spaces and Dreams in Muriel Rukeyser’s “The Speed of Darkness” </h1>

<h3 align=center>Trent Wintermeier </h3>


In 1969, American poet Muriel Rukeyser read a group of thirteen poems entitled “The Speed of Darkness” at Sir George Williams University. I argue in this project that digitally-annotating Rukeyser’s reading of the spaces between each stanza in this poem facilitates a new, sonic reading of the poem, one which is shaped through the practice of listening to “doubleness” in “The Speed of Darkness.”
